This is 16 bit operating system for x86-64 processors
I am a 12 year old beginner programmer who wants to create his own OS, but there is one thing, I can't really do anything good, and I can't even do the transition to 64-bit mode or the transition from VGA to Ves. In general, I will develop my own 16-bit OS, everyone who can help - please help! I don't really understand how to make interrupts yet, but if you can, then help me make them.
